- Auto-refreshes weekly NIFTY options after expiry and includes NIFTY future in live feed.

## Logging

The application uses [Logback](https://logback.qos.ch/) for logging. Logs are written to
`logs/app.log` with daily rotation and a maximum size of 10â€¯MB per file.

To forward logs to an external service such as Papertrail, Logtail or Graylog,
configure the following environment variables:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `LOG_AGGREGATOR_HOST` | Hostname of the log collector. |
| `LOG_AGGREGATOR_PORT` | TCP port of the collector. |
| `LOG_AGGREGATOR_TOKEN` | Optional API key/token if required by your provider. |

You can also set `LOG_DIR` to change the directory where local log files are
stored (defaults to `logs`).

## Authentication

The frontend redirect target used after a successful Upstox login can be
configured via the `AWS_REDIRECT_URL` environment variable. The current value
can be retrieved from the backend at `GET /auth/redirect-url`.
